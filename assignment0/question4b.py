The probability of one of the participants never choosing forward
during the 5 possible rounds is (4/5)^5.
The probability for all three to never choose to face forward is ((4/5)^5)^3.
The probability for two to never choose to face forward is (((4/5)^5)^2)*2.
The probability for 1 to never choose forward: ((4/5)^5)*3
Add the probability of all three never choosing forward to the probability
of two never choosing to face forward to the probability of one person 
never choosing to face forward. 
This is equal to 0.47
The probability luigi wins is 1-0.47 = 53% of the
